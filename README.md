My git hub account is just me having a repository and nothing else too crazy, meaning no designs or anything, just made the repository so far.
My repository name is Hammytherammy.github.io, So far I completed all the steps, I have cloned the repository, and added a README, etc.
The steps to clone was, it gave me an option to clone the repository and I chose to clone it, and it asked me which files did I want it saved in and so I selected the desktop file, and when I open it, it has a README.
